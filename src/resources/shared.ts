   *
   *      Timestamp timestamp;
   *      timestamp.set_seconds(tv.tv_sec);
   *      timestamp.set_nanos(tv.tv_usec * 1000);
   *
   * Example 3: Compute Timestamp from Win32 `GetSystemTimeAsFileTime()`.
   *
   *      FILETIME ft;
   *      GetSystemTimeAsFileTime(&ft);
   *      UINT64 ticks = (((UINT64)ft.dwHighDateTime) << 32) | ft.dwLowDateTime;

   *      timestamp.set_nanos((INT32) ((ticks % 10000000) * 100));
   *
   * Example 4: Compute Timestamp from Java `System.currentTimeMillis()`.

   *
   *      Timestamp timestamp = Timestamp.newBuilder().setSeconds(millis / 1000)
   *          .setNanos((int) ((millis % 1000) * 1000000)).build();
   *
   * Example 5: Compute Timestamp from Java `Instant.now()`.
   *
   *      Instant now = Instant.now();
   *
   *      Timestamp timestamp =
   *          Timestamp.newBuilder().setSeconds(now.getEpochSecond())

   *
   * Example 6: Compute Timestamp from current time in Python.
   *
   *      timestamp = Timestamp()
   *      timestamp.GetCurrentTime()
   *
   * # JSON Mapping
   *
   * In JSON format, the Timestamp type is encoded as a string in the
   * [RFC 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) format. That is, the format is
   * "{year}-{month}-{day}T{hour}:{min}:{sec}[.{frac_sec}]Z" where {year} is always
   * expressed using four digits while {month}, {day}, {hour}, {min}, and {sec} are
   * zero-padded to two digits each. The fractional seconds, which can go up to 9
   * digits (i.e. up to 1 nanosecond resolution), are optional. The "Z" suffix
   * indicates the timezone ("UTC"); the timezone is required. A proto3 JSON
   * serializer should always use UTC (as indicated by "Z") when printing the
   * Timestamp type and a proto3 JSON parser should be able to accept both UTC and
   * other timezones (as indicated by an offset).
   *
   * For example, "2017-01-15T01:30:15.01Z" encodes 15.01 seconds past 01:30 UTC on
   * January 15, 2017.
   *
   * In JavaScript, one can convert a Date object to this format using the standard
   * [toISOString()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString)
   * method. In Python, a standard `datetime.datetime` object can be converted to
   * this format using
   * [`strftime`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html#time.strftime) with the
   * time format spec '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ'. Likewise, in Java, one can use the
   * Joda Time's
   * [`ISODateTimeFormat.dateTime()`](<http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/apidocs/org/joda/time/format/ISODateTimeFormat.html#dateTime()>)

   * In JSON format, the Timestamp type is encoded as a string in the
   * [RFC 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) format. That is, the format is
   * "{year}-{month}-{day}T{hour}:{min}:{sec}[.{frac_sec}]Z" where {year} is always
   * expressed using four digits while {month}, {day}, {hour}, {min}, and {sec} are
   * zero-padded to two digits each. The fractional seconds, which can go up to 9
   * digits (i.e. up to 1 nanosecond resolution), are optional. The "Z" suffix
   * indicates the timezone ("UTC"); the timezone is required. A proto3 JSON
   * serializer should always use UTC (as indicated by "Z") when printing the
   * Timestamp type and a proto3 JSON parser should be able to accept both UTC and
   * other timezones (as indicated by an offset).
   *
   * For example, "2017-01-15T01:30:15.01Z" encodes 15.01 seconds past 01:30 UTC on
   * January 15, 2017.
   *
   * In JavaScript, one can convert a Date object to this format using the standard
   * [toISOString()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString)
   * method. In Python, a standard `datetime.datetime` object can be converted to
   * this format using
   * [`strftime`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html#time.strftime) with the
   * time format spec '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ'. Likewise, in Java, one can use the
   * Joda Time's
   * [`ISODateTimeFormat.dateTime()`](<http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/apidocs/org/joda/time/format/ISODateTimeFormat.html#dateTime()>)
   * to obtain a formatter capable of generating timestamps in this format.
