   * Creates a development environment from a context URL (e.g. Git repository) and
   * starts it.
   *
   * The `class` field must be a valid environment class ID. You can find a list of
   * available environment classes with the `ListEnvironmentClasses` method.
   *
   * ### Examples
   *
   * - Create from context URL:
   *
   *   Creates an environment from a Git repository URL with default settings.
   *
   *   ```yaml
   *   spec:
   *     machine:
   *       class: "d2c94c27-3b76-4a42-b88c-95a85e392c68"

   *           - contextUrl:
   *               url: "https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod"
   *   ```
   *
   * - Create from Git repository:
   *
   *   Creates an environment from a Git repository with specific branch targeting.
   *
   *   ```yaml
   *   spec:
   *     machine:
   *       class: "d2c94c27-3b76-4a42-b88c-95a85e392c68"
   *     content:
   *       initializer:
   *         specs:
   *           - git:
   *               remoteUri: "https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod"
   *               cloneTarget: "main"
   *               targetMode: "CLONE_TARGET_MODE_REMOTE_BRANCH"
   *   ```
   *
   * - Create with custom timeout and ports:
   *
   *   Creates an environment with custom inactivity timeout and exposed port
   *   configuration.
   *
   *   ```yaml
   *   spec:
   *     machine:
   *       class: "d2c94c27-3b76-4a42-b88c-95a85e392c68"
   *     content:
